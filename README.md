# AI, Safely
Content for my instagram and TikTok accounts on AI Safety.

## Specifics
Instagram Reels are 1080 pixels wide and 1920 pixels tall. Matplotlib works with DPI so, as explained in [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13714720/6068731) post, we need to figure out the correct size based on the display of the laptop where the code is run on. I am using a MacBook Pro M3 which has a dpi of `96` according to [this](https://www.infobyip.com/detectmonitordpi.php) website.
